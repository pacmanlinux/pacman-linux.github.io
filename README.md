## Overview
PacMan Linux is a versatile, lightweight Arch-based distribution designed primarily as a **Developer Workstation** with a rich set of Developer tools and software out of the box - Plus a curated selection of essential **CyberSecurity Tools**. 

Its perfect for programmers, sysadmins, security researchers, and power users who want a flexible, secure and performance-optimized OS without unnecessary bloat.

Unlike other security distros such as Kali or BlackArch, PacMan Linux takes a **modular** approach instead of shipping hundreds or thoasands of pre-installed tools, it provides **building blocks** that let *you* decide which cybersecurity tools to install and maintain.
